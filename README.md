  Project Features 

The Personal Finance Tracker includes several useful features that help users manage their daily financial activities with ease. One of the key features of this project is the ability to add new transactions. Users can enter the date, a short description, and the amount for each transaction, allowing them to record both income and expenses in a clear and organized manner. Each transaction is stored in a text file, ensuring that the data remains saved even after the program is closed.

Another important feature is the option to view all recorded transactions. This allows users to see their financial history at any time. The program reads the stored data from the file and displays each transaction with its date, description, and amount, giving the user a complete overview of their financial activities.

The project also provides a feature to check the current balance. By reading all saved transactions and calculating the sum of their amounts, the program can quickly display the user’s total balance. This helps users understand how much money they have left based on their past income and expenses.

Overall, the Personal Finance Tracker offers a simple but effective way to manage personal finances. With features like adding transactions, viewing history, and checking balance, it serves as a helpful tool for anyone looking to track their financial activities in a basic and straightforward manner.
